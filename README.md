<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Synaptic metaplasticity is a biological phenomenon shortly defined as the plasticity
of synaptic plasticity, meaning that the previous history of the synaptic activity
determines its current plasticity. This phenomenon interferes with some of
the underlying mechanisms that are considered important in memory and learning
processes, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression. In this
work, we provide an approach to include metaplasticity in convolutional neural
networks to enhance learning in image classification problems. This approach
consists of including metaplasticity as a weight update function in the backpropagation
stage of convolutional layers.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Flask RESTPlus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
* [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install and configure CUDA.
* Check your NVIDIA driver.
* Update the NVIDIA display driver.
* Check your PATH environment variable.



### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vvives/metaplasticity-rest-api.git
   ```
2. Install python libraries with the following command:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Execute the WSGI or the Dockerfile within the corresponding folder.

    ```sh
    python wsgi.py
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Go to the default URL http://localhost:5000/ and visualize the Swagger interface.
2. Select any image classification problem: MNIST, Fashion MNIST or CIFAR-10.
3. Select the convolutional neural network architecture endpoint: alexnet, googlenet or lenet.
4. Click the button Try it out.
5. Use the image by default or load any of your own.
6. Click the button Execute and wait for the predicted value.
